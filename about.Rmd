My project is to compare the salaries of players in the English Premier League to their performace metrics to identify players who are possibly over/underpaid. I scraped data on metrics like goals, assists, and shots from [Fox Sports](https://www.foxsports.com/soccer/stats?competition=1&season=20190&category=STANDARD&pos=0&team=0&isOpp=0&sort=3&sortOrder=0&page=1) and player contract data from [Spotrac](https://www.spotrac.com/epl/contracts/).
